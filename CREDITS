This extension and skin is due to Matthew Wall and is copyright by him. The
details are in the file "cmon-readme.txt" which is a copy of his original 
"readme.txt".

The only change to date (April 2019) is the name of the public_html directory
where the cmon files are. Eventually the extension will be modified for
Raspberry Pi (requires schema changes) and the skin will be subsumed by
the weewx-orcas-skin skin.
